Phil Wackerfuss hails from the land of Chicago, IL. With a BA in Theatre Arts from Illinois Wesleyan Univ, he came to Buffalo 4 years ago to work for Buffalo's premier touring dance company, <a href=\"http://www.lehrerdance.org/\">LehrerDance</a>. With LehrerDance, he has travelled across the country and the globe, using experience from all kinds of theatrical performance to wow audiences from Germany to Russia in the LehrerDance jazz-modern style of circularity, 3-dimensionality, and momentum that we call \"Organic Athleticism\". Always wanting to expand talents and enhance physical feats, Phil picked up something like a staff from a prop mistress and began playing with incorporating it in a dance. Drawing inspiration from martial arts, modern dance, and a sense of mythology, Phil is honing his fire-play with staff, sword, and whatever else works naturally with his body, seeing it all as part of a larger practice of meditation and wholeness of being. Self-taught in spinning for a year, he has recently joined forces with Pyromancy and continues to spread knowledge and learn from the varied experiences of those around him.
