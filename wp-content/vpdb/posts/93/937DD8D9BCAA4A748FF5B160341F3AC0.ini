post_content = "We'd like to thank everyone who came out to Curtain Up! last night, we had an amazing time.  If you have any pictures or video, we'd love to add them to our portfolio, drop us a message at info@pyromancy.org  

I'd like to give special thanks to the Bijou Grill for helping us with power at last minute, Channel 4 for the coverage in their preview special, The VAuLT where we helped kick off their one year anniversary party, and most of all to Jerry Burgin who coordinated the entire Curtain Up! event.  

Pyromancy will be having a business meeting 7pm, September 14th at Towne Restraurant, for all performers, safeties, newbies, photographers, musicians, anyone who wishes to be involved in our collective.  We've got a lot to go over, there's much excitement abound.
