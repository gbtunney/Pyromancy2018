post_content = "I go by Mandy, and Mandemonium (the keeper of Pandemonium). The Doktor showed me the fire long ago, and soon I couldn't resist. I've only been playing with fire for a year or so, and fire baton is my specialty. I do fancy hand movements and tosses hoping to shock and amaze....the oohhhss and ahhhs of the crowd...be still my heart. The fire poi is more of an amusement, but it loosens me up for the fire, oh yes, the fire baton. :}

I also enjoy keeping the fire at bay as a safety. As much as I love to see the flames rise up, I like to see them go out in a safe fashion.
