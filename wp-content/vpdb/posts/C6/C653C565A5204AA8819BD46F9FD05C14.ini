<p>Pyromancy takes safety seriously, and we dedicated to providing secure and positive experience.</p>

<p>Each of our performers has gone through a professional fire safety class, adhere to good practice in performance, and perform safety/equipment checks before every performance. We bring a full compliment of safety equipment, not limited to; audience barrier markers, fire extinguishers, fire proof towels, first aid kit, MSDS sheets for all fuels and chemicals, insurance policy documentation and an unblemished record of safety.</p>

<p>Before finalizing plans for a show we will come and examine the performance space to ensure adequate space and to check for any potential hazards. Before each show,we set up a fuel dump well away from the audience and performers, check all equipment for damage, go over our communications. During the show, a dedicated safety will monitor not only the performers, but the audience and surrounding areas. We reserve the right to modify or refuse a performance if we do not feel we can safely perform in a venue. Glow/LED and non-fire performances can also be arranged to accommodate the venue.</p>

<p>We adhere to <a href=\"http://www.nafaa.org/nafaa_safety.html\">North American Fire Arts Association safety regulations and guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://www.pyromancy.org/about/performers/fuego/\">Fuego</a> is the group's lead safety coordinator. She holds American Red Cross Certifications in First Aid and CPR.</p>
