post_content = " If you are here because you want to spin fire, we're more then excited to have you! Even if you've never picked up a toy before, we are more then willing to teach. Right now, we generally practice alongside the Buffalo Jugglers in Delaware Park. We're not there all the time, but there is always a great group of awesome people who will teach you something. If you drop us a message, we can make sure to go or arrange for a meetup when it's more convenient.
