<i>( <a href=\"http://buffalorising.com/2013/10/the-witches-ball-a-masquerade-october-31-2013/\">Excerpt from Buffalo Rising</a> )</i> For the second year, I’m happy to announce that The Witches Ball will be played out at The Hotel @ The Lafayette. Riding on the success of its inaugural outing as a macabre masquerade, this year we are turning up the heat by offering more live music, more dance acts, and more mayhem in general (while keeping in mind that the event is hosted inside an elaborately restored historic hotel in the heart of Downtown Buffalo).

Besides being a masquerade, where partygoers will fit right in by just wearing a suit or a dress, along with a mask, there will also be cash prizes for best overall costume, sexiest guy/girl, and best steampunk getup. We’re adding a second banquet room for the steampunkers too. Called Cirque du Steam (presented by <a href=\"http://jphii.com/\">JPHii Design</a>)…
