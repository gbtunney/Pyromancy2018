( <i><a href=\"http://www.buffalofirst.org/balle2013\" target=\"_blank\">From Buffalo First</a></i> ) Calling all Localists! Once per year our community assembles for a can’t-miss gathering that is a who’s who of innovators collaborating to build a new economy. From international thought leaders and on-the-ground social entrepreneurs, to policymakers, network builders, local economy funders, philanthropists, and everyone in between, Localists of all stripes will be descending on Buffalo, New York June 12-14, 2013 to share the work of building a new economy.

Our conference is an immersive experience that will put you at the center of passionate action and innovative solutions, and give you the fuel you need to amplify your work at home. Standing in line for lunch you’re likely to meet someone running a start-up kitchen and food hub, a person of significant wealth who is combining philanthropy and investment dollars to build local living economies in a particular place, an entrepreneur who has created a network of businesses to localize apparel manufacturing, a bank president who is building a triple bottom line approach to strengthening their particular economy, a farmer and organizer who is building food security in the food desert of Detroit, and a systems thinker who is weaving the frame within which we flourish.
