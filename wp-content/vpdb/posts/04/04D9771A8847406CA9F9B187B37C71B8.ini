Safe and Professional


What we provide:
Awesome fire performance!
Trained safety techs with fully equipped first aid and safety equipment.
Lighted perimeter ropes if needed.
Venue inspection before anything is agreed upon.  
Small sound system with our own music.


Show formats:

Street performance, two or three performers will alternate with different acts, fire eating, sometimes a story or simple duets.  15-20 minute sets.    

Circle Show, With more performers, we can do a longer, more energy intensive set.  Quick changes between performers, fire and non-fire performances, juggling, fire eating, acrobatics, if space allows, more complex duets and trio performances. 30-40 minute sets.

Choreographed Routines:  Have a specific piece of music you want a fancy performance for, or need fire performers for a film/theater production?  Depending on the length, desired complexity, and practice time, we can work on custom performances.  

Non-fire Performances:  We have growing supply of exciting non-fire props that look just as good, if not better then our fire performances. Please keep an eye on our video page for previews in the coming weeks.  Non-fire performances are quite a bit cheaper and can be really fantastic for day time events. 

Fire Spinning Safety Coordination for Festivals:  Got a music festival you want to let attendees spin fire at?  We can provide safety classes, skill/competency vetting, running a safe spin area, and help designing a comprehensive safety program for your festival.  

Suggestions:  
Two to four performers for 20-40 minutes is a really good show.  We only recommend longer performances if there is going to be a moving audience, or other concurrent acts, such as music festivals.  We are still building our repertoire and expect to be able to offer more complex performances soon. 

Available upon request:
Fire Breathing - Fire Breathing is pretty risky to the performer, it isn't a skill we are really that into.  It is not part of our general packages but can be provided on request.

Colored Fire - We have been experimenting with colored flames, they look pretty wild, but don't come cheap.  

Live Music - From drum circles to concert violinists, we know a number of musicians
