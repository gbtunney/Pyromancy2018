Leo started learning fire poi in Tucson from the University of Arizona Street Performance and Incendiary Arts Club in 2003. After one year with SPIA then sitting-President Mathew Johnson of FireMecca.com graduated and he succeeded him. Leo's style is a mix of Aikido footwork, burst rhythms, and technical trickery. His own graduation swept him away to another realm of foreign immersion, experimental psychedelic rock-metal, naturalism, and mixed media art. For several years he had been without affiliation and poi had been a fire-side entertainment medium for him to share only with friends. He's grateful now to be a card-carrying “magician” out in the Buffalo streets sharing his blood with the wind and watching you gasp and wince!
