This comprehensive 2 hr workshop will cover everything you need to know about safely dancing and spinning with fire. The workshop will start with a lecture followed by a Q&A session. Then we will follow with hands on practice putting out both props and people. Afterwards we will have time to play and have a wide variety of props to demo and try.

Workshop session will be capped at 20 to maintain personalized atmosphere. Reserve your spot in advance with discounted presale tickets above. Class fee is $40 payable in cash on arrival at the event. All people are welcome, especially those who have never used fire before!  If you are new or a solo fire spinner, consider bringing a friend who would like to learn to be your safety. Discounted presale tickets are available for pairs above. This is a rain or shine activity as the amphitheater provides adequate protection. Please bring warm clothing and something to sit on. All participants must be sober. 

Class materials will include a variety of handouts like safety guidelines and check lists, MSDS sheets for common fuels, contacts and online resources.

<u><strong>We will be covering:</strong></u>
- Mandatory safety equipment and proper protocol
- Protecting yourself
- Fuel selection
- What is a Fire Safety Person and why you need one every single time you play with fire
- How to set up a safe fire spinning area and fuel dump
- How to extinguish a prop, person or fuel dump fire
- Communication between safeties, spinners and audience.
- LOCAL fire law regulations and event permits
- Communicating effectively with authorities
- Discussion of recent negative events in the news, changing legal situations, and the future of fire arts

We really can't stress enough, proper safety is needed if we want to keep fire spinning legal. Two recent accidents in Florida, coupled with increased legislation in cities like NYC, SF, Seattle, and elsewhere, have put fire spinning in the legal cross-hairs. We have a great situation here in Buffalo and really want to keep it that way! Come learn how to be responsible and safe for yourself and others!
