<a href=\"http://localhost/PYROMANCY2016/wordpress/2011/06/buffalo-riverfest/\">Last month we got to perform at the opening weekend of a new park on Ohio St.</a> Once a common post-industrial waste field, thanks to the work of Margaret \"Peg\" Overdorf and the <a href=\"http://www.thevalleycenter.com/\">Valley Community Association</a>, Buffalo now has a fantastic new concert venue and boating park. For the next three weeks we will be performing between sets probably around 9pm.

Only Humen, also a Buffalo Hall of Music award winner and popular throughout Western New York, will perform on August 3rd. The band is led by Frank Pusateri who is native to the South Buffalo area.

Crash Cadillac, the fun interactive oldies band, will be featured on August 10th.

The series will wrap up on Wednesday, August 24th with the Town Pants, an international touring act. The Town Pants band, which hails from Vancouver, Canada, combines aspects of traditional Irish music, folk rock, and Americana, creating a unique brand of high energy “West Coast Celtic.” With their performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and at festivals throughout United States, Canada and Europe, the group is a consistent audience favorite.

Food and refreshments will be available at all concerts.
