- A. Artaud

J.D. Devine has juggled fire for nearly twenty years, and has had a lifelong fascination with fire. Fire fascinates us all: it is an aetheric but deadly substance (if it indeed has substance at all). Handling fire is dangerous, but confronting that danger is what fire handling is all about. J.D. juggles torches and the high tech FireFly © Balls, which give an up close and personal experience with the fire. In addition to the fire, he also juggles knives, a bowling ball… just about anything! He is constantly updating his skills, and recently took a workshop with the Flying Karamazov Brothers. Let’s hope J.D. continues to dazzling us with death defying and gravity defying feats!
