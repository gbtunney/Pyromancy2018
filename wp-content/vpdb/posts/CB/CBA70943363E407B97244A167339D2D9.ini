Greetings Earthlings! Prepare yourself for a close encounter of the partying kind. Whether you're a hard core trekkie, a casual watcher of late-night, B-rated science fiction movies, or just someone who likes having a good time, Party for the Parks promises to be an Intergalactic Blast to celebrate our 10th Annual Party for the Parks, the Marcy Casino in Delaware Park will be transformed into Buffalo's very own Area 51, replete with Martian go-go dancers, heavenly music, UFO-inspired light shows, and so much more to explore.

Get in the spirit by dressing as your favorite space alien. Don't have a costume? Not to worry... there will be a team of makeup artists on site to help complete your extraterrestrial look. Join 1,000 or so of the parks' closest friends on September 7, 2012 for a party that will be out of this world."
