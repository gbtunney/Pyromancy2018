post_content = "The first time Kindle saw someone perform with fire she knew it was something she needed to do. Beginning as a self-taught poi spinner she eventually branched out into other props including fans, dart, fleshing and eating. As her passion for the dance pushed her to connect with others she began attending wildfire retreats and eventually left Buffalo to focus on developing as a performer. She worked as a traveling street performer and collaborated with other spinners in Maine and Oregon until finally settling in Tucson, Arizona to work with the troupe Elemental Artistry. Presently Kindle is happy to be back in Buffalo working with Pyromancy and working to develop existing prop skills and partner performance. Kindle loves sharing, exchanging, learning and jumps at the opportunity to trade skills with other performers, artists and magic makers.
